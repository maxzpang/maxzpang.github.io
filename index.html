                    <div class='body'>
                        <p>I write a ton on the computer, whether it’s for our <a href="http://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog">product blog</a>, internal documents, product <a href="http://www.fulcrumapp.com/help">help guides</a>, this blog (rarely), or many other things, I tend to stick to the same set of tools for different pieces of my writing workflow.</p>
                        <p>Everything I write, even things like meeting notes only for myself, I write in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>. It’s essentially muscle memory at this point. I write for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>-based websites quite a bit, I write issues and wiki pages on GitHub, I keep my personal journal in <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>, and several other places. All of them accept Markdown as input, so I’ve just formed a habit over the years where I write everything that way. So when I paste an unordered list from a note I made somewhere into a web document, it’s already formatted. If the destination for a block of content I wrote doesn’t work with Markdown, most tools have a “copy plain text” option that I’ll use if I want the raw words to format inside of another application (<em>*cough*</em> Microsoft Word <em>*cough*</em>).</p>
                        <p>Anyway, onto the geeky stuff…</p>
                        <h2 id="tools-we-all-love-tools">Tools, we all love tools</h2>
                        <p>I try tons of new tools all the time, and I’ve converted through different tools over the years. About 90% of writing is thinking, so being able to flexibly organize thoughts without fighting with tools is paramount to productive writing. Remember that the tools <em>don’t make you write</em>. I try to prevent myself from getting distracted with whatever the new “app of the week” is for text editing, and while having the proper tools is important, if your process ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Just like with todo lists, code editors, and online courses, another tool in the belt doesn’t make you a better producer… <em>producing</em> makes you a better producer<sup id="fnref:b2w25"><a href="#fn:b2w25" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you’re like me, it’s worth posting that above your desk to keep from fiddling with tools and systems and get to work. If you’re doing anything other than typing the words on the page, the tool isn’t going to help you make more letters appear! <em>(I write that as a reminder to myself as much as anyone else.)</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, with that said, here’s the short list of apps I use for writing, and for what purpose I use each depending on context:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a></strong>: This is the everyday workhorse. Since I write <em>everything</em> in plain text files, this editor from <a href="https://twitter.com/ttscoff">Brett Terpstra</a> is my go-to for fast access to making new files. It’s typically the initial scratch pad while I’m on my Mac. If I jump on a phone call, I pop open nvALT and create a new text file to log notes. With quick keyboard shortcuts, every time I make a file it just appears in my <code>txt</code> directory in Dropbox, which other apps (including mobile ones) can have access to. It’s an unfancy writing tool for longform stuff, but the key is that there’s minimal friction between thought or idea and it being instantly captured in a reliable place.</li>
                            <li><strong><a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a></strong>: Used for longer-form editing, basically once something reaches the stage of an official piece of content like an article or guide, more than lists or scratch notes. It’s got a great interface for writing in Markdown, and a built-in preview mode for seeing the content rendered as HTML. Stuff that will end up on the web as articles usually happens here.</li>
                            <li><strong><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></strong>: I use Atom for editing things that involve code, or are typically intertwined with code like HTML or CSS. When I’m writing documentation for Fulcrum or contributing to other projects on GitHub, I use Atom.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paper, the IRL kind</strong>: If I don’t have access to my computer, I don’t feel like typing, or I want to make sketches, I keep <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">field notes</a> around for pen and paper notes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 id="ios-apps-where-writing-is-typically-harder">iOS apps, where writing is typically harder</h2>
                        <p>Longform content doesn’t usually happen much on iOS for me, unless the motivation strikes me to get my thoughts on paper and I’m not at my computer. Mostly from iOS I’m keeping notes or jotting things down.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a></strong>: What nvALT does on my desktop, Drafts does on my phone. Since most of the time from mobile I’m starting with a <em>new file</em> versus editing something in progress, Drafts is super fast for jumping right into a text edit mode to type out some quick notes. Where Drafts really comes into its own, though, are in its Actions capabilities. The idea is that anything starting as a piece of text can be fed into an Action within Drafts to pipe it into any of dozens of other places. Getting to know what’s possible in Drafts is <a href="/post/drafts/">a separate post</a> in and of itself, but needless to say, it’s where I do probably 90% of my text typing on iOS.</li>
                            <li><strong><a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a></strong>: I’ve just discovered this app recently after reading Federico Viticci’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/">stunningly in-depth review</a>, and so far it’s a promising addition to the writing process from iOS. I’ve never been a heavy iPad user, but I’ve been debating jumping back into the iPad world again, particularly for working on something at home on the weekend, traveling, or otherwise mobile without my laptop. This app is ridiculously complex and powerful, and I’ve only started to scratch the surface.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many people like Evernote and other cloud-based services for dealing with notes, but I like the idea of the archive of text I’ve produced since about 2009 all lives in plain files in a folder — completely portable, easy to back up, and generally friendly to copy or import into other places for publishing. I don’t need separate notebooks or embedded attachments or tagging on my files to get in the way, I just want an editor and the canvas for text. All of the tools I mentioned above have excellent full text searching capabilities, and after 6 years of managing all of my notes this way, search has never failed me for finding what I need.</p>
                        <p>One thing that my personal workflow doesn’t support directly (or at least I haven’t found a way) is on-the-fly collaborative editing. Most of the content I write is for myself, or at least doesn’t need to have other editors for most of its existence until it’s ready, but maybe there are tools out there I’ve not yet discovered. Currently for anything that needs to be collaborative from the get go I would use Google Docs, since it’s unmatched when it comes to real-time simultaneous multiuser editing. Other than that, anything that happens for publishing via GitHub already can be collaborated on asynchronously using pull requests and commit references, which our team uses constantly.</p>
                        <p>If readers have any suggestions of other methods for augmenting things, particularly collaborative editing a la Google Docs, ping me on <a href="http://twitter.com/colemanm">Twitter</a>, I’d love to find more options to make my flow even better.</p>

                        <p>CGP Grey has a good post on dialing down the volume of self-invited Internet noise for a month. On letting in too many little inputs over time:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Arguments about the quality of news aside, he came to realize the ‘overwhelmed’ problem wasn’t about the number of things to do, but was about the number of things he let into his brain. The news is a rather effective vehicle for delivering a large number of small things: each story a single guest arriving to a party.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Individually the guests don’t make a lot of noise, but adding one by one makes the collective volume creep up in a way unnoticeable until you take a break from the conversation and realize that it’s way too loud in here.
                                <br />
                                <br /> The solution was to kick most of the guests out and be more careful at the door: college-me stopped reading the news and cut back on TV. The number of non-actionable things on the mind decreased, and with that did the amount of ‘overwhelm’.</p>

                        <p>Geoff Manaugh’s latest looks at <a href="http://scanlabprojects.co.uk/">ScanLAB</a>’s project to explore the bits of cityscape that LiDAR technology is making visible to robotic cars. Things humans overlook suddenly become visible (and dangerous):</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University and author of the book “Robot Futures,” uses the metaphor of the perfect storm to describe an event so strange that no amount of programming or image-­recognition technology can be expected to understand it. Imagine someone wearing a T-­shirt with a stop sign printed on it, he told me. “If they’re outside walking, and the sun is at just the right glare level, and there’s a mirrored truck stopped next to you, and the sun bounces off that truck and hits the guy so that you can’t see his face anymore — well, now your car just sees a stop sign. The chances of all that happening are diminishingly small — it’s very, very unlikely — but the problem is we will have millions of these cars. The very unlikely will happen all the time.”</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>All of the glares, reflections and misunderstood signs that Nourbakhsh warned about are exactly what ScanLAB now seeks to capture. Their goal, Shaw said, is to explore “the peripheral vision of driverless vehicles,” or what he calls “the sideline stuff,” the overlooked edges of the city that autonomous cars and their unblinking scanners will “perpetually, accidentally see.”</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>It’ll be interesting to see how this technology changes the physical built environment to make it more “robot-friendly”.</p>

                    <h1><a name='11.10.2015' href='/post/siri-reminders/'>Task Capture with Siri & OmniFocus </a></h1> <span class='meta'>November 10, 2015 &bull; <a href='/post/siri-reminders/' title='Permalink'>#</a></span>
                    <div class='body'>
                        <p>I’ve <a href="/post/rediscovering-gtd/">talked before</a> about the concept of “ubiquitous capture” and how achieving a system where you never lose an item is an ideal for a seamless GTD setup. No matter what task management tool you use of the hundreds of options, both automatic or analog, there are still moments when a fleeting piece of info we want to remember — either something new to do or an idea or breakthrough on an existing project task — slips through the cracks. The best system for managing all of your collective “stuff” is any that you trust to be the go-to place for all the things that require your attention.</p>
                        <p>In any GTD-esque system, the two core concepts are <strong>capture</strong> and <strong>review</strong>:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Capture</strong> anything on your mind so it lives in a system, not in your head.</li>
                            <li><strong>Review</strong> your “inbox” on some repeated schedule to process things into the right place, grouping things by project, adding deadlines, or filing into contexts.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>When I got started building my personal workflow, I found the biggest initial hurdle was a reliable mechanism for getting things into my inbox as quickly and readily as possible. I’ve tried notebooks, cards, text files, and most digital task apps to try and find a single tool that works, but there was always friction and things would get forgotten. My short term memory is horrendous, and most things needing to find their way into my inbox would occur to me while getting ready in the morning or while driving or biking to work.</p>
                        <h2 id="enter-siri">Enter Siri</h2>
                        <p>True ubiquitous capture is achieved by using whatever tools are most reliably available to you, and for me that’s OmniFocus and my iPhone. OmniFocus 2 for iOS added a built-in <a href="https://support.omnigroup.com/collecting-with-siri-in-omnifocus-2">Reminders capture</a> feature to pull things added to a specific list over into the OF inbox. Then using the “Siri, add this to my list…” command when dictating gives you hands-free, fast access to append items to the inbox. I say things like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Add assemble new furniture to my inbox list”</li>
                            <li>“Add get flu shot to my inbox list”</li>
                            <li>“Remind me to take out the trash when I get home” (using <a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/omnifocus2-iphone-locations/">location-aware contexts</a> in OF)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With Siri set up this way, I now have a wider funnel for capturing anything I’m thinking about anywhere I’ve got my phone. So even when I’m in the car or working in the garage and some random item pops into my head, I can make sure it doesn’t slip through. It’ll be there waiting in my inbox for the next review when I’m processing my workload.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>It was with these thoughts that I finally got to Deadhorse, which may rank as the most horrific place on planet Earth. If Stalin had built a gulag in the cargo area of Kennedy Airport, it would probably look like Deadhorse. The town, if you can call it that, is the apotheosis of petrochemical dismalness: a wasteland of oil tanks, acetylene fires, heavy-machine repair shops and spill-abatement companies that is drenched in freezing rain and pocked with muddy puddles, and where everyone I encountered wondered what in the world I was doing there at all.</p>

                            <p>Dawn hasn’t yet broken, but already coal fires are burning and women are frying beignets. Other passengers have risen from their foam mattresses and begun to lay out their wares for sale: soap, batteries, herbal potions, shoes, rancid whiskey. Soon visitors from deep in the bush will paddle up in their pirogues and hoist themselves spiderlike aboard the barges, bearing their own products to barter: bananas, catfish, carp, boas, baboons, ducks, crocodiles. The floating marketplace will proceed throughout the day, with as many as a dozen pirogues lashed to the boat at any given time. It soon becomes clear to us that the regimen is completely symbiotic and anything but frivolous. Absent this commerce, the passengers don’t eat and the villagers don’t have medication for a baby’s fever or a new pot to replace the rusted one.</p>

                    <div class='body'>
                        <p>I recently wrote <a href="http://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/review-staying-secure-with-1password/">a review</a> on the Fulcrum blog for one of my favorite pieces of software, <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>. It’s a password management app to help you keep better organized with your hundreds of passwords, codes, and secure data that you typically have laying around in emails, documents, and post-it notes on your desk<sup id="fnref:gobuyit"><a href="#fn:gobuyit" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
                        <p>I’m a heavy user of 1Password on my iPhone to look up accounts while I’m mobile. Because 1Password vault security is only as secure as your <a href="https://support.1password.com/strong-master-password/">master password</a>, the natural tendency is to have a long, complex, intricate passphrase to type to unlock the vault. And from the iPhone, you want your vault to <em>re-lock</em> pretty rapidly so the door to your digital safe isn’t left swinging open while your phone’s sitting on the table. The net result is having to constantly type a hard-to-type passphrase on a <em>hard-to-type-on</em> device. No good and no fun.</p>
                        <p><img src="/images/post-images/touch-id.png" alt="Touch ID" title="Touch ID for iOS" />
                        </p>
                        <p>My problems were solved a few weeks ago I finally enabled the Touch ID functionality in 1Password 5 for accessing your vault using your fingerprint, versus typing the 30-character password<sup id="fnref:1password5"><a href="#fn:1password5" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. After using it like this for a few days, it seemed less secure to me, since it wasn’t even requiring my impressively-complicated password to get in. I dug into some of the documentation to find out how secure the implementation of Touch ID authorization is in 1Password, and how Touch ID works in iOS.</p>
                        <p>The app documentation has a <a href="https://support.1password.com/how-safe-is-touch-id/">great article</a> outlining exactly how Touch ID works within 1Password. For a long time it had a “PIN Code” feature to have a quick access code for unlocking the vault <em>after</em> you had recently unlocked the vault with your master password, and the Touch ID feature works similarly. The data is still encrypted with the master password. It’s designed explicitly as a mechanism for adding convenience to the process, which is a critical component to maintaining good security best practices:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“Just as Apple has designed Touch ID not as a replacement for a device passcode, we do not use Touch ID in 1Password as a replacement for your Master Password. Touch ID is a convenience mechanism that provides a way to quickly unlock 1Password after there has been a full unlock (with your Master Password).”</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The intersection of convenience and security <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2014/10/06/touching-on-security-and-convenience/">is interesting</a>. They’re fundamentally opposite: a totally secure system is extremely inconvenient to access, a convenient one is insecure. The best systems strike a balance somewhere in the center. The problem with highly secure but inconvenient systems is that they entice users to defuse the security of the whole system by taking shortcuts. Think of the corporate IT environment with all the bells and whistles on security—password strength requirements, required resets every month, can’t reuse passwords, minimum lengths—it’s this massive inconvenience that results in the post-it note on the monitor with the keys to the kingdom written on it.</p>
                        <p>The security of how Touch ID’s technology works is another matter, one of hardware and storage. With the release of the A7 processor in 2013, Apple introduced something called the Secure Enclave<sup id="fnref:apple-security"><a href="#fn:apple-security" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, which allows applications to store bits completely outside the scope of the kernel on a physically isolated area of the chip. This is where biometrics get stored, along with cryptographic data for other applications. Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204587">technical documentation</a> about Touch ID security covers in minute detail exactly how iOS devices store your fingerprint data on the Secure Enclave, and the ultimate reason why Touch ID is actually <em>more secure</em> than not using it:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“Since security is only as secure as its weakest point, you can choose to increase the security of a 4-digit passcode by using a complex alphanumeric passcode. To do this, go to Settings &gt; Touch ID &amp; Passcode and turn Simple Passcode off. This will allow you to create a longer, more complex passcode that is inherently more secure.”</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This is a key point that’s relevant at the OS level and within apps like 1Password or banking apps using biometrics. If, because of the convenience factor, biometrics enable people to keep their encryption passphrases more secure at the core, then we’re all better off.</p>

                        <p>The link jumps right to the discussion of ads and the ethics of content blocking in current publishing landscape. Rene Ritchie has some interesting thoughts on the subject and wrote <a href="http://www.imore.com/content-blockers-bad-ads-and-what-were-doing-about-it">a piece on iMore</a> about it. Ads, Javascript embeds, and trackers are toeing the line on privacy (if not crossing it), but more simply than that, they’re making the Internet slower and more obnoxious to use. Ad networks, however scummy, <em>are</em> keeping the sites we like afloat.</p>
